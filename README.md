# Experiments with Bulgarian Words

`generate-bgwords.sh` -- generates a huge file `bgwords` with all Bulgarian words and their variations using `aspell`, around 18MB, more than 800K words.

`fly-elephant.py` -- find a single-letter substitution path from `муха` to `слон`.

`add-letter.py` -- plays a game of adding a letter to a grid, so that it's the last letter of a dictionary word.
